cityinfra game

## long time goal
the lonng time goal: have a city infrastructure simulation game thats more realistic

## fundamentals
* 1 meter in reality is 1 meter in the game
* 1 second in reality is 1 second in the game
* physics mapped from reality into the game eg. car / train acceleration
* construction times mapped from reality into the game

## features
### infrastructure wise

* rails
* electricity grids with
    * substations
    * power generation
        * solar
        * wind

Q: But dude, I then have to wait ages to until a construction is done ðŸ˜´  
A: This is correct. The game has a mode to speed up time (everything runs faster) or you can yum a specified amount of time forward.
